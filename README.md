# Spam-Detection-Algorithm

Developed and trained a machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not messages were "spam" or "ham." 

Used NLTK and Count Vectorization to convert all the messages into a sparse matrix. Then used TF-IDF to give each word a weighted score based on how many times a word appears in a document and finally used the Naive-Bayes Classifier algorithm. I then implemented a data pipeline to include transformations. 


**Results**:
Precision Weighted Average of 96%.
Recall Weighted Average of 96%.
F1-Score Weighted Average of 96%.

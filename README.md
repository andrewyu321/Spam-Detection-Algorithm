# Spam-Detection-Algorithm

Developed and trained a machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not messages were "spam" or "ham." 

The libraries I used were NLTK to help me filter out common stop words in the messages. Then implemented a data pipeline to set up all the transformations to use such as CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, and Naive-Bayes classifier algorithm. 

**Results**
Precision Weighted Average of 96%.
Recall Weighted Average of 96%.
F1-Score Weighted Average of 96%.
